% The cleanser is based upon a circuit between three TikZ keys:
%   input --(1)-> process --(2)-> output

% First we define three possible behaviors of the expansion to be performed on
% the input before processing.  These correspond to three mutually exclusive
% different wirings for (1).  By default the no-expansion route is wired.
\pgfqkeys{/cleanser/expand}{.is choice,
  none/.style={/cleanser/input/.style={/cleanser/process={##1}}},
  once/.style={/cleanser/input/.style={/cleanser/process/.expand once={##1}}},
  full/.style={/cleanser/input/.style={/cleanser/process/.expanded={##1}}},
  none,} % default behaviour

% Then we wire (2) using the Plain TeX sanitizer and the TikZ gizmo to handle
% console output that we're defining later.
\pgfqkeys{/cleanser/process}{.code={
  \kDSanitize#1\into tmp\GO
  \pgfkeysalso{/cleanser/log={\Meaning = "\tmp"}}
  \pgfkeysalso{/cleanser/output/.expand once=\tmp}},}

% Here is the handler for console output.

      \message{kD.cleanser ~~~ > #1^}

% Here is the main reason for all this: a style to make a node self-naming.
% Again, it's just a matter of wiring a simple sircuit.
\pgfqkeys{/tikz/self naming node}{.style={
  /tikz/node contents/.forward to=/cleanser/input,
  /cleanser/output/.forward to=/tikz/alias,},} % TODO: is alias the correct choice here instead of name?

% No more TikZ code is needed.  What follows s just the Plain TeX sanitizer.
