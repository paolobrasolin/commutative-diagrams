As you'll have guessed by now, objects name themselves.

The process happens in three steps:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item expand tokens;
  \item replace characters;
  \item apply name, overwriting if necessary.
\end{itemize}

Each one can be configured in any \CoDi\ scope with the keys.

While you're getting acquainted with the process
you can use the \lstinline|/codi/prompter| key to
display labels with generated names.

\begin{tcblisting}{snippet}
\begin{codi}[prompter]
  \obj{ A & \lim A \\ };
  \mor A f:-> (lim A);
\end{codi}
\end{tcblisting}
